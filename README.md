# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Api-From-Scratch
* Added conv2D or conv3D layers with different strides, padding and filter sizes <br/>
* used dilated convolutions  <br/>
* Used max pooling with different sizes and strides<br/>
* Added fully connected layers<br/>
* Added as many layers to neural network as they want<br/>
* Can specify the activation function at the end of each layer<br/>
* able to use cross entropy loss<br/>
* able to use Adam optimizer<br/>
