# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Api-From-Scratch
Added conv2D or conv3D layers with different strides, padding and filter sizes
used dilated convolutions
Used max pooling with different sizes and strides
Added fully connected layers
added as many layers to neural network as they want
Can specify the activation function at the end of each layer
able to use cross entropy loss
able to use Adam optimizer
